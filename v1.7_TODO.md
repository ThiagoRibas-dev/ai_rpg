# v1.7 Final UI Polish TODO List

## Phase 1: UI Changes
- [x] **Modify `MainView` Layout:**
  - [x] Remove the "Save Game" button from the `_create_control_panel_widgets` method.
  - [x] Disable the "Send" button by default in the `__init__` method.
- [x] **Update `MainView` Logic:**
  - [x] In the `on_session_select` method, enable the "Send" button.
  - [x] In the `on_prompt_select` method, disable the "Send" button (as the session selection is cleared).

## Phase 2: Automatic Session Naming
- [x] **Update `new_game` Method:**
  - [x] Remove the `CTkInputDialog` that prompts for a session name.
  - [x] Add logic to generate a session name using the format `{yyyy-mm-dd_hh:mm}_{Prompt_Name}`.
  - [x] Use the `datetime` module to get the current timestamp.

## Phase 3: Automatic Saving
- [x] **Update `handle_send` Method:**
  - [x] In `orchestrator.py`, after the AI response is received and added to the session, call the `update_game` method.
  - [x] Pass the currently selected session from the `MainView` to the `update_game` method. This will require a small change to the `handle_send` method to accept the session as an argument.

## Phase 4: Final Testing
- [x] **Test the New Workflow:**
  - [x] Verify that the "Save Game" button is gone.
  - [x] Verify that the "Send" button is disabled until a session is selected.
  - [x] Verify that the "New Game" button creates a new session with the correct timestamp-based name.
  - [x] Verify that the game state is automatically saved after each AI response.
