# Roadmap

This document outlines the planned features and development milestones for the AI-RPG project.

## v1: Core Engine

*   **Narrative Engine:** A robust core engine for managing the game's narrative, including a flexible LLM connector system to support various models.
*   **Session Management:** The ability to save, load, and manage game sessions.
*   **GUI:** A functional user interface for interacting with the game, including a chat-style interface for the narrative.

## v2: Gameplay Systems

*   **Tool System:** A system that allows the LLM to use tools to perform deterministic actions, such as rolling dice, checking rules, or managing inventory.
*   **State Management:** A structured system for managing the game state, including character sheets, inventory, and world state.
*   **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** A system for retrieving information from a knowledge base, such as a rulebook or lore document, to provide more contextually relevant responses.

## v3: Extensibility and Intelligence

*   **Plugin Architecture:** A system that allows for the creation of third-party plugins to extend the game's functionality, such as new tools, content, or even core systems.
*   **Advanced Agency:** Exploration of more advanced AI techniques, such as multi-agent systems (e.g., a separate "Game Master" agent) and more sophisticated planning capabilities.
*   **Dynamic World:** Features that allow the game world to evolve and change in response to player actions, creating a more dynamic and immersive experience.
