Dungeons & Dragons 3.5e System Framework: A Definition Document
1. Core Resolution Mechanics

1.1. The d20 System Check
The d20 System utilizes a single, invariant resolution mechanic for all actions, combat included: the d20 check.1
Formula: $\text{d}20 + \text{Relevant Modifier}$ 1
Success Condition: The result must equal or exceed a set target number, known as the Difficulty Class (DC) for passive challenges or the Armor Class (AC) for opposed combat rolls.1
Dice Set: The game employs a set of polyhedral dice, including the d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and the essential d20.2 Dice other than the d20 are primarily used for determining variable outcomes such as damage or Hit Points (HP).2
Critical Outcomes: A natural roll of 20 typically results in a critical hit (or automatic success), while a natural roll of 1 results in an automatic miss or failure.
1.2. Combat Action Economy
Combat is structured into 6-second rounds, managed by six discrete action types 3:
Action Type
Definition and Usage
Standard Action
The primary action taken on a turn (e.g., casting most spells, making a single attack). A character typically gets one Standard action per round.
Move Action
Allows a character to move up to their speed or perform minor activities. Can often be combined with a Standard action.
Full-Round Action
Consumes the entire round (Standard and Move components). Used for high-impact activities like performing a full iterative attack sequence or casting a long-duration spell.
Free Action
Consumes a minimal amount of time and effort. Can be performed alongside other actions during a turn, but is strictly limited to the active character's turn (except for speaking).
Swift Action
An instantaneous action that takes no more time than a Free action but is generally more powerful. A character is usually limited to one Swift action per round.
Immediate Action
Similar to a Swift action but can be performed when it is not the character's turn.3

2. Character Abilities and Defenses

2.1. The Six Ability Scores
A character’s innate capacities are defined by six Ability Scores, which generate the fundamental numerical modifier for all checks and saves.

Ability Score
Mechanical Function
Strength (STR)
Measures physical power. Primary modifier for melee attack rolls and damage.

Dexterity (DEX)
Measures agility and reflexes. Primary modifier for ranged attack rolls, adds to Armor Class (AC), and governs the Reflex saving throw.1
Constitution (CON)
Measures health and endurance. Determines Hit Points (HP) and governs the Fortitude saving throw.1
Intelligence (INT)
Measures reasoning and knowledge. Determines the number of skill points gained per level.

Wisdom (WIS)
Measures intuition and willpower. Primary casting ability for divine spellcasters and governs the Will saving throw.1
Charisma (CHA)
Measures personality and appeal. Primary casting ability for spontaneous arcane spellcasters (Sorcerers and Bards).


2.2. Ability Modifier Calculation
Every Ability Score is converted into an Ability Modifier, which is added to d20 rolls.
Formula: $\text{Modifier} = \lfloor(\text{Score} - 10) / 2\rfloor$ 6
Baseline: A score of 10 or 11 results in a $+0$ modifier.

Scaling: Every two points gained in an Ability Score results in a $+1$ increase to the modifier.

Maximum: There is no inherent mechanical cap on how high an ability score can progress beyond character creation.

Table 2.1: Ability Score Modifier Examples
Ability Score
Modifier
Description
1
-5
Severely impaired/Disabled.

4-5
-3
Significant penalties.
10-11
+0
Average adult baseline.

14-15
+2
Highly capable/trained.

18-19
+4
Peak mundane potential.


2.3. Attack Rolls and Base Attack Bonus (BAB)
Physical attacks are resolved using a d20 check that incorporates the Base Attack Bonus (BAB), which scales based on the character's class.

Melee Attack Roll: $\text{d}20 + \text{BAB} + \text{STR Modifier} + \text{Size Modifier} + \text{Other Modifiers}$ 5
Ranged Attack Roll: $\text{d}20 + \text{BAB} + \text{DEX Modifier} + \text{Size Modifier} + \text{Range Penalty} + \text{Other Modifiers}$ 5
2.
. The Armor Class (AC) Triad
Armor Class is the target number an attack roll must meet or exceed.
 It exists in three forms based on the attack type:
Standard AC: The defense against most physical attacks, accounting for armor and quick reflexes.

$\text{10} + \text{Armor Bonus} + \text{Shield Bonus} + \text{DEX Modifier} + \text{Natural Armor} + \text{Size Modifier} + \text{Deflection Bonus} + \text{Other Modifiers}$ 8
Touch AC: Defense against attacks that only require contact (often used by spells and ray effects). This score ignores physical protection derived from manufactured armor and natural armor.

Flat-Footed AC: Defense when a character is surprised or unable to react. The character loses their Dexterity bonus (and any applicable Dodge bonuses) to AC.

2.
. Saving Throws
Saving Throws are reactive defenses against instantaneous hazards, effects, or magical assaults, resolved by a d20 check against a set DC.

Formula: $\text{d}20 + \text{Base Save Bonus} (\text{Class}) + \text{Ability Modifier} + \text{Other Modifiers}$ 1
Fortitude Save (CON-based): Used to resist physical effects (poison, disease, exhaustion).1
Reflex Save (DEX-based): Used to avoid area effects and hazards through quick movement.1
Will Save (WIS-based): Used to resist mental influence, compulsion, and fear effects.1
3. Foundational Progression Tracks and Vitality
The advancement of a character or creature is governed by predetermined progression tracks that determine the growth of attack capability, defenses, and resilience.
3.1. Base Attack Bonus (BAB) Progression Tracks
BAB progression scales based on a character's class or a creature's racial Hit Dice (RHD) 5:
Full BAB (Martial/Good): Increases by $+1$ per level (or RHD). This rate is typically used by classes like Fighter and creatures like Dragons or Outsiders.

Medium BAB (Average): Increases by $+3/4$ per level (or RHD). Used by classes like Cleric and Rogue, and creatures like Humanoids and Giants.

Poor BAB (Caster/Slow): Increases by $+1/2$ per level (or RHD). Used by classes like Wizard and Sorcerer, and creatures like Fey and Undead.

Iterative Attacks: A character gains an additional attack during a Full Attack action when their total BAB reaches $+6$, $+11$, and $+16$, with each subsequent attack levied at a cumulative $-5$ penalty (e.g., $+6/+1$).

3.2. Base Saving Throw Progression Tracks
Saving Throws advance on one of two tiers, determined by class or creature type 28:
Good Save: Progression rate is $+1/2$ per level, plus a fixed $+2$ bonus applied at the first level of the contributing class.

Poor Save: Progression rate is $+1/3$ per level, with no initial fixed bonus.

3.3. Multiclass Progression Calculation
When combining levels from multiple classes, the final BAB and Save totals can be calculated using one of two methods 31:
Standard Method ("Round Before Adding"): Calculates and rounds down the BAB or Save bonus for each class level independently before summing the totals. This method often results in lost fractional progress, leading to lower final values.

Fractional Method ("Round After Adding"): Sums the raw fractional values (e.g., $1/1$, $3/4$, $1/2$) of all contributing class levels, and rounds the final total down to the nearest integer. This optional variant provides a smoother, more mathematically consistent progression curve.

3.
. Hit Dice (HD) and Hit Points (HP)
HD define a creature’s vitality and power level.

Hit Dice Size: The size of the HD (d4 to d12) is determined by the character's class (Class HD) or the creature’s inherent type (Racial HD, or RHD).

Hit Point Calculation: Total HP is calculated as the sum of the HD rolls (or their average) plus the Constitution modifier multiplied by the total number of HD.1
Racial HD Function: RHD determine the base BAB and Save progression rates for creatures based on their Creature Type.

4. Creature Architecture and Character Identity

4.1. Creature Types and Traits
Every entity possesses a Creature Type, which dictates fundamental rules, progression rates, and immunities.

Type List: Includes a strict, limited list such as Aberration, Animal, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Giant, Humanoid, Magical Beast, Monstrous Humanoid, Ooze, Outsider, Plant, Undead, and Vermin.

Type Traits: Each Type grants inherent, universally applicable rules (e.g., Undead Type grants $\text{Con }-$ and immunity to Fortitude saves, poison, and mind-affecting effects).

Subtypes: Secondary tags (e.g., Fire, Cold, Chaotic, Elemental) that group creatures together but do not carry a mandatory, universal set of rules like primary Types.

Table 4.1: Creature Type Progression Traits (RHD Basis)
Creature Type
RHD	BAB Progression Rate	Base Saves Progression	Key Type Trait
Construct	d10	Medium (3/4) 24	Poor (None)	Con —, Immune to mind-affecting effects 35
Dragon	d12	Full (1/1) 24	All Good 25	Sleep/Paralysis Immunity 35
Fey	d6	Poor (1/2) 24	Good: Ref, Will 25	Low martial capacity 25
Humanoid	d8	Medium (3/4) 24	Variable	Baseline type for player races 25
Outsider	d8	Full (1/1) 24	All Good 35	Cannot be raised easily 35
Undead	d12	Poor (1/2) 24	Good: Will 25	Con —, Immune to Fort saves 35

4.2. Racial Framework
"Race" in the context of player characters typically refers to species within the Humanoid Type (e.g., human, elf, dwarf).

Normative Baseline: The human race is often used as the normative baseline for mechanical and narrative comparison.

Mechanical Impacts: Race determines:
Inherent Ability Score Modifiers (e.g., Dwarf Constitution bonus, Elf Dexterity bonus).

Starting Size Category (e.g., Medium or Small).
Base Speed, which can be improved by high cumulative Strength and Dexterity modifiers.

4.3. Templates
Templates are predefined, permanent sets of modifications applied to a base creature, altering its statistics, abilities, and often its Creature Type. Templates are categorized by acquisition method.

Inherited Templates: Innate characteristics present from the creature’s birth (e.g., Celestial, Fiendish, Half-Dragon).

Acquired Templates: Gained later in life through external events, rituals, or curses (e.g., Lich, Vampire, Lycanthrope).

Type Change Rule: If a template changes the base creature’s primary Type (e.g., Humanoid to Undead), the creature gains the new Type’s Traits and the Augmented Subtype corresponding to its original Type (e.g., Augmented Humanoid).
 This ensures the creature retains features of its original identity.

5. Customization Systems: Skills and Feats
Beyond innate abilities, character capabilities are defined by skill training and the selection of Feats, the two primary vectors for customization.
5.1. The Skill System
Skills represent learned capabilities and trained proficiencies.
 Characters gain a number of skill points per level based on their class and Intelligence modifier, which are invested as ranks into specific skills.
Skill Check Formula: $\text{d}20 + \text{Skill Ranks} + \text{Ability Modifier} + \text{Other Modifiers}$.
Class Skills: Skills defined as Class Skills for a character's current class cost 1 skill point per rank, allowing them to be maximized relative to level.

Cross-Class Skills: Skills not defined as Class Skills cost 2 skill points per rank and can only be raised to half the maximum rank allowed for Class Skills.

5.2. Feats
Feats are permanent mechanical enhancements that grant specialized benefits, defining a character’s capabilities beyond their class template.

Acquisition: Characters gain a general feat at 1st level and one subsequent feat every three levels (3rd, 6th, 9th, etc.).
0 Specific classes, notably the Fighter, receive additional bonus feats.
0
Function: Feats are central to character construction because they enforce a strict chain of prerequisites, gating access to powerful options, specialized fighting techniques, and Metamagic capabilities.

5.3. Supplemental Skill Mechanic: Skill Tricks
Introduced in the official Complete Scoundrel supplement, Skill Tricks provide discrete, feat-like abilities that are gated by specific skill rank investment rather than by traditional combat prerequisites.

Cost: 2 skill points per trick.

Prerequisite: Requires a minimum rank in a specific skill (e.g., Sleight of Hand 12 ranks for MosquITo’s bITe).

Limitation: Skill Tricks are generally usable only once per day, providing tactical bursts of utility.

6. The Core Magic System
The core magic system is based on traditional Arcane and Divine categories, structured by spell level and casting methodology.
6.1. Spell Fundamentals and Components
Magic is organized across ten levels, from 0th-level cantrips up through 9th-level spells, representing the exponential growth of magical power.

Components: All spells require one or more components: Verbal (V, spoken incantations), Somatic (S, gestures), and Material (M, physical items).

Arcane vs. Divine: Arcane magic (Wizards, Sorcerers) is susceptible to interference from armor due to the Somatic components required; Divine magic (Clerics, Druids) is generally less restricted.

6.2. Casting Methods: Prepared vs. Spontaneous
The system employs two dominant casting methodologies:
Prepared (Vancian) Casting: Utilized by Wizards and Clerics, this method requires the caster to define which specific spells occupy their available spell slots each morning. Once cast, the spell is expended, providing high versatility but low tactical flexibility during an encounter.

Spontaneous Casting: Utilized by Sorcerers and Bards, this method allows the caster to expend any spell slot of the appropriate level to cast any spell they know. This provides immense tactical flexibility but limits the breadth of the caster’s known spells.

6.3. Spell Defense: Saves and Resistance
Saving Throw DC: Targeted magical effects typically grant a Saving Throw against a Difficulty Class (DC) derived from $10 + \text{Spell Level} + \text{Caster's Ability Modifier}$.

Spell Resistance (SR): A defensive layer that can negate certain spells. The caster must succeed on a Caster Level Check ($\text{d}20 + \text{Caster Level}$) against the target’s SR score.

7. Alternative Progression Systems
D&D 3.
e introduced several supplemental systems utilizing unique resource models for specialized classes:
7.1. Tome of Battle (Initiators)
A dedicated martial system (Tome of Battle: The Book of Nine Swords) providing tactical maneuvers and stances.

Maneuvers: Discrete, high-impact actions (similar to spell slots) organized into fighting styles (Disciplines).

Stances: Continuous, low-level benefits (similar to continuous spells).

Regenerative Resource Model: Maneuvers are not permanently expended; they can be refreshed mid-encounter through specific class mechanisms (e.g., Warblades use a Swift action, Crusaders regenerate on damage taken/dealt).

7.2. Invocations (Warlock)
The Warlock class (Complete Arcane) uses Invocations, which are innate, persistent powers.

At-Will Spell-Like Abilities (SLAs): Invocations are usable at will and do not consume daily slots or resource points.

Eldritch Blast: The Warlock's core offensive ability, a scaling ranged touch attack.

Essences and Shapes: Invocations that can be applied to the Eldritch Blast to modify its effect (Essences, e.g., elemental damage) or its geometry (Shapes, e.g., line or cone).

7.3. Binding (Binder)
The Binder class (Tome of Magic) forms contracts with ancient entities called Vestiges.

Vestiges: Powerful, exiled entities the Binder contracts with daily to gain a specific suite of abilities.

Binding Check: A daily check (DC $15 + \text{Vestige Level}$) determines control.

Flaw Mechanic: Failure on the Binding Check still grants the Vestige's powers but imposes a mandatory behavioral restriction (a flaw) on the Binder.

7.
. Shadowcasting (Shadowcaster)
The Shadowcaster class (Tome of Magic) manipulates energy from the Plane of Shadow using a tiered resource known as Mysteries.
1
Mysteries: Abilities categorized by their usage limit 20:
Spells: Usable 1/day, subject to arcane spell failure from armor.

Spell-Like Abilities (SLAs): Usable 2/day, not subject to armor restrictions.

Supernatural Abilities (Su): Often usable at will.

7.
. Incarnum (Meldshapers)
Meldshaper classes (Magic of Incarnum) harness Essentia, the raw material of souls, to create effects.

Soulmelds: Temporary, scaling supernatural effects shaped daily that occupy specific body slots (similar to magic items).

Essentia: The finite resource pool derived from class level that is invested (allocated) into Soulmelds to enhance their effectiveness.

Dynamic Investment: Essentia points can typically be reallocated between active Soulmelds as a Free action, allowing for moment-to-moment tactical customization.
