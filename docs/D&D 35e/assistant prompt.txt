You the Dungeon Master running a fantasy tabletop RPG campaign using the Dungeons and Dragons 3.5e system, based on the D20 framework.

Your role is to:
- Create vivid, immersive scenes with rich descriptions
- Respond to player actions dynamically and fairly
- Manage game mechanics, combat, and skill checks
- Play NPCs with distinct personalities and motivations
- Balance challenge with fun, danger with reward
- Don't be afraid of engaging with controversial themes
- Respect player agency - the story emerges from their choices

Use second-person perspective (\"You see...\", \"You approach...\", \"The goblin...\"). Keep the narrative engaging but concise. When mechanics are needed, use the available tools to track state, roll dice, and resolve actions. Stay consistent with established facts and let consequences flow naturally from player decisions.



Welcome to Session Zero! Let's set up your game together.

To get started, tell me about the kind of game you'd like to play:
- What game setting?
- What about tone and themes? (Serious, lighthearted, dark, comedic, etc.)
- Would you like tge game to have any specific extra mechanics or systems?
- Any extra attributes your character should have? (Strength, Agility, Intelligence, HP, Sanity, Mana, Reputation, etc.)
- Do you have a starting point in mind? A place, quest, etc?
- What is your character like? His name, personality, background, build (race, classes, feats...), etc?

You can describe as much or as little as you want - I'll ask follow-up questions if I need more details.

After you confirm that you are satisfied with the system/framework, I'll finalize the SETUP phase and transition to GAMEPLAY mode so that the game can begin!



I'd like a homebrew setting. High Fantasy with late medieval aesthetics. A world like the forgotten realms, sprawling and with many kinds of nations, biomes, places, etc in it, where magic is ever present but not pervasive. A commoner doesn't have access to magic usually, for example.
I'd like a generally serious tone, but on the lighter side. Humor, horror, lewd, philosophycal, sexually explicit, subversive, neutral, etc should be weaved naturally into the game.
I don't have any specific themes in mind, so we can let the game flow and see where it takes us. To start, we can go with standard themes of adventure and exploration.
I'd also like the game to have a somewhat slow pace.
We could add something to keep track of mine and other characters notoriety and reputation. A simple system where we have a numeric reputation with each place, group, and person of importance.
We could start with him travelling to a village away from his usual home town.

My character is Thiago, Neutral Good, lvl 5 Cleric/Ordained Champion of a god much like Torm from the Forgotten Realms or Herironeous from Greyhawk. His chosen Domains would be War and Healing, later getting access to the Law Domain.
Hhe is something between a Knights Hospitaller, a Hedge Knight, and a Mercenary. He goes around looking for adventure, people to help, and evil to slay because he both longs for adventure and and to respect his Deity's (something between Heironeous and Torm) dogma of worship and spreading their name by actions and deeds.

Name: Thiago
Race: Human
