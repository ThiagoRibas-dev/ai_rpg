# Dungeons & Dragons 3.5e: Comprehensive Rules Reference

# Part I: The Basics

### The Core Mechanic
Whenever your character attempts an act that has some chance of failure, the process is:
1. Roll a d20.
2. Add all relevant modifiers (from ability scores, skills, feats, etc.).
3. Compare the result to a Target Number (Difficulty Class or an opponent's roll).

Formula: `d20 Roll + Modifiers ≥ Target Number` (Success)

### Dice Notation
	Standard Dice: An expression like `3d4+3` means: Roll three 4-sided dice, sum the results, and add 3.
	Percentile Dice (d%): Roll two 10-sided dice (d10). Designate one as the "tens" digit and the other as the "ones" digit. A roll of `0` on the tens die and `5` on the ones die is 5. A roll of two `0`s is 100.

### Mathematical Rules
	Rounding: Always round down, even if the fraction is one-half or larger, unless a rule specifies a minimum of 1 (such as for Hit Points or damage).
	Multiplying:
		Abstract Values (Modifiers, Rolls): When multiple multipliers apply, combine them. The first multiplier works normally. Each additional multiplier adds 1 less than its value. (Example: A `x2` and another `x2` multiplier results in a `x3` multiplier (`2 + (2-1) = 3`). Three doubles results in a quadruple.)
		Real-World Values (Distance, Weight): Use normal multiplication. (Example: Doubling weight (`x8`) then turning to stone (`x3`) results in `x24` total weight.)

### Order of Rules Application
The D&D game assumes a specific order of rules application: General to specific to exception. A general rule is a basic guideline, but a more specific rule takes precedence. An exception is a particular kind of specific rule that contradicts or breaks another rule.

### Time
Time works for characters in the imaginary world of D&D like it does in the real world. Minutes, hours, days, and months can pass as the characters explore and grow in power. Only during certain situations is the measure of time more precise. Then the round is used.
	Round: Combat is played in rounds. Each round represents 6 seconds in the game world, regardless of how long it takes to play out the round. A minute contains 10 rounds.



# Part II: Character Building Blocks

### Races
Your race determines your starting ability adjustments, size, speed, and special features.

### Ability Scores
An ability score's modifier is calculated as: `(Score - 10) / 2`, rounded down.

| Score | Modifier | Score | Modifier | Score | Modifier |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | -5 | 12-13 | +1 | 24-25 | +7 |

| 8-9 | -1 | 20-21 | +5 | etc. | ... |
| 10-11 | +0 | 22-23 | +6 | | |

The Six Abilities

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Strength (Str) | • Melee attack rolls<br>• Melee/Thrown weapon damage rolls<br>• Strength-based skill checks<br>• Strength checks (e.g., breaking doors) | Climb, Jump, Swim |

#### Ability Score Loss
Some attacks deal damage to an ability score in the form of ability damage or ability drain.
	Ability Damage: Temporarily reduces a score. If, during a 24-hour period, a creature gets a full 8 hours of sleep, that creature recovers 1 ability score point per damaged ability score. Complete bed rest doubles this rate. Long-term care (Heal check DC 15) can also double recovery.
	Ability Drain: Permanently reduces a score. Only restored by magic (such as restoration).

Losing All Points
A score cannot drop below 0.
	Strength 0: Helpless. Cannot move.
	Dexterity 0: Helpless. Motionless and rigid.
	Constitution 0: Dead.
	Intelligence 0: Unconscious (comalike stupor). Helpless.
	Wisdom 0: Unconscious (deep sleep with nightmares). Helpless.
	Charisma 0: Unconscious (catatonic stupor). Helpless.

#### Nonabilities
Some creatures lack an ability score entirely (marked as "—"). The modifier is +0.
	No Strength: Can't exert force. Physical manipulation is impossible.
	No Dexterity: Can't move. Auto-fails Reflex saves.
	No Constitution: No body or metabolism (undead/constructs). Immune to Fortitude saves (unless harmless/works on objects), ability damage/drain, fatigue, and exhaustion.
	No Intelligence: Mindless. Immune to mind-affecting effects. Auto-fails Int checks. No feats/skills.
	No Wisdom: Is an object, not a creature.
	No Charisma: Is an object, not a creature.

		*Max Class Rank:* Level + 3
		*Max Cross-Class Rank:* (Level + 3) / 2
6.  Feats: Gain a new feat at levels 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18.
7.  Spells/Features: Gain new class features or spell slots defined by the class level.

| 20th | 190,000 | 23 | 11.5 | — | Yes |

*(Note: Feats are gained every 3 levels; Ability Scores every 4 levels.)*

#### Prestige Classes
Prestige classes offer specialized power but cannot be taken at 1st level. You must meet specific Prerequisites (e.g., "Base Attack Bonus +5", "Cast 3rd-level arcane spells") before taking the first level of a prestige class.
	Common Examples: Arcane Archer (Elf Bowman), Assassin (Evil Killer), Blackguard (Fallen Paladin), Dragon Disciple (Draconic heritage), Duelist (Finesse fighter), Loremaster (Secret keeper), Mystic Theurge (Arcane/Divine caster mix), Shadowdancer (Stealth expert).

### Size
Creatures come in nine size categories: Fine, Diminutive, Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, Gargantuan, and Colossal. Size modifiers affect AC, Attack Bonus, Hide checks, and Grapple checks.
	Little Creatures (Tiny, Diminutive, Fine): Take up less than 1 square. Have 0 reach (must enter opponent's square to attack, provoking AoO).
	Big Creatures (Large+): Take up more than 1 square. Usually have Reach (10 ft+).

### Skills
General Skill Rules
	Skill Check Formula: `d20 + Skill Ranks + Ability Modifier + Misc. Modifiers`
	Skill Ranks:
		Class Skill: 1 rank per skill point. Max rank = `Character Level + 3`.
		Cross-Class Skill: 1/2 rank per skill point. Max rank = `(Character Level + 3) / 2`.

#### Advanced Skill Rules

Skill Synergy
Certain skills complement each other. If you have 5 or more ranks in one skill, you gain a +2 Synergy Bonus on checks involving a related skill.

| 5 Ranks in... | Gives +2 Bonus to... |
| :--- | :--- |
| Bluff | Diplomacy, Disguise (acting), Intimidate, Sleight of Hand |
| Handle Animal | Ride, Wild Empathy |
| Jump | Tumble |
| Knowledge (Arcana) | Spellcraft |
| Knowledge (Local) | Gather Information |
| Knowledge (Nobility) | Diplomacy |
| Search | Survival (following tracks) |
| Sense Motive | Diplomacy |
| Spellcraft | Use Magic Device (scrolls) |
| Tumble | Balance, Jump |
| Use Magic Device | Spellcraft (deciphering scrolls) |

Opposed Checks
When your skill use interacts with another character (e.g., you hide, they look), both roll. The higher result wins. Ties go to the character with the higher modifier.
	*Examples:* Hide vs. Spot; Bluff vs. Sense Motive; Move Silently vs. Listen.

Combining Skill Attempts
	Individual Events: Climbing a wall. Each character rolls independently.
	Aid Another: You can help an ally if you have at least 1 rank in the skill (or are trained). You make a DC 10 check.
		*Success:* Ally gains a +2 circumstance bonus.
		*Expertise:* If the helper has 5+ ranks, the bonus may increase (DM discretion).
		*Combat:* You can also Aid Another in combat (Standard Action, AC 10 vs opponent) to give an ally +2 to hit or +2 AC against that opponent.

Checks and Success
	Take 10: When not threatened or distracted, you can opt for a result of 10 on the d20 roll.
	Take 20: With ample time and no penalty for failure, you can opt for a result of 20 on the d20 roll. This takes 20 times longer than a normal check.
	Degrees of Success: Usually, meeting the DC is enough. Sometimes beating it by 5 or 10 yields better results.
	Aid Another: Make a DC 10 check with the same skill to give an ally a +2 bonus.
	Skill Synergy: Having 5 or more ranks in one skill gives you a +2 bonus on checks with specific related skills.

### Feats
Feats represent special tricks, talents, or training that a character has acquired. Unlike skills, which are graded ranks, feats are binary: you either have the feat or you don’t.

Acquiring Feats
Every character gains at least one feat at 1st level.
	Standard Progression: 1st level, 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, 18th (every 3 levels).
	Class Bonus Feats: Fighters, Wizards, and Monks gain specific bonus feats at set levels.
	Human Bonus: Humans gain 1 extra feat at 1st level.

Prerequisites
Some feats have requirements (e.g., *Str 13*, *Base Attack Bonus +1*, or another feat like *Dodge*).
	You must meet all prerequisites to select the feat.
	If you lose a prerequisite (e.g., your Dexterity drops below 13 due to a curse), you lose access to the feat and any other feats that rely on it until the prerequisite is restored.

#### Feat Categories
While most feats are "General" (usable by anyone), some fall into special categories with specific rules:

	Combat Feats: Often grant special attacks or maneuvers. Fighters may select these as bonus feats.
	Item Creation: Allow spellcasters to craft magic items (Scrolls, Potions, Arms & Armor). These require an expenditure of XP and Gold.
	Metamagic: Allow casters to modify spells (e.g., cast silently or with max damage).
		*Cost:* Modifying a spell usually uses a higher-level spell slot.
		*Preparation:* Wizards prepare the modified spell in the higher slot. Sorcerers/Bards take a full-round action to cast a metamagic spell.
	Metapsionic: The psionic equivalent of Metamagic. Costs psionic focus and extra power points.
	Wild: Requires the *Wild Shape* ability. Usually costs one daily use of Wild Shape to activate a special effect.
	Divine: Requires the ability to *Turn/Rebuke Undead*. Costs daily turn attempts to power divine effects.
	Psionic: Requires a Power Point reserve or Psi-Like abilities. These are supernatural abilities.

# Part III: Exploration & Movement

### Movement Modes
Your speed is determined by your race and encumbrance. You can move your speed as a move action.
	Tactical Movement:
		5-Foot Step: If you move no other distance in a round, you can move 5 feet without provoking Attacks of Opportunity (AoO).
		Run: Full-round action. Move x4 speed (x3 in heavy armor). Lose Dex to AC.
		Withdraw: Full-round action. Move x2 speed. The first square you leave is not threatened.

Encumbrance
Total weight carried determines load.
	Light Load: No penalty.
	Medium/Heavy Load: Max Dex bonus decreases, Armor Check Penalty applies to skills, Speed reduced (30 ft becomes 20 ft; 20 ft becomes 15 ft).

Special Movement Skills
	Balance (Dex): Move on precarious surfaces. Being attacked while balancing denies Dex bonus to AC unless you have 5 ranks.
	Climb (Str): Move at 1/4 speed. Vulnerable to attacks (lose Dex to AC).
	Jump (Str): Long Jump (DC = distance), High Jump (DC = distance x4). Needs 20 ft running start or DC doubles.
	Swim (Str): Move 1/4 speed. Failure by 5+ results in going underwater (holding breath required).
	Tumble (Dex):
		DC 15: Move through threatened area without provoking AoO.
		DC 25: Move through opponent's square.
		Move at half speed unless you take -10 penalty.

Flying
	Maneuverability: Classified from Clumsy to Perfect. Affects turning radius, hovering, and reverse flight.
	Minimum Speed: If an aerial creature doesn't maintain forward speed (unless it can hover), it falls.

### Overland Movement & Getting Lost
	Local Scale: Walk, Hustle, or Run.
	Overland Scale: Measured in miles/hour or miles/day (8 hours travel).
		Walk: 3 mph (24 miles/day).
		Hustle: 6 mph. Deals nonlethal damage after 1 hour.
		Forced March: Walking more than 8 hours requires Constitution checks (DC 10 + 2/extra hour) or take nonlethal damage and fatigue.
	Terrain: Highways (x1), Roads (x1), Trails (x1), Trackless (x1/2 to x3/4).
	Getting Lost: In poor visibility or difficult terrain, lead character makes Survival check each hour. Failure means random movement.

### The Environment
The Battle Grid
	1 square = 5 feet.
	Diagonals: First diagonal counts as 1 square (5 ft). Second counts as 2 squares (10 ft). Pattern repeats (5, 10, 5, 10).

Vision and Light
	Bright Light: Clear vision.
	Shadowy Illumination: Concealment (20% miss chance).
	Darkness: Total Concealment (50% miss chance).
	Line of Sight: Straight unblocked line between your square and target.
	Line of Effect: Straight unblocked line for effects (spells). Glass blocks Line of Effect but not Sight.

Senses
	Listen (Wis): Hear noise. Beat DC by 10 to understand content; by 20 to pinpoint location.
	Spot (Wis): See hidden things. Distance penalty -1 per 10 ft.
	Search (Int): Active inspection (within 10 ft).
	Blindsight: Operate perfectly without sight (bats, oozes). Negates invisibility/darkness.
	Blindsense: Notice things without sight, but less precise (knows square, but still has miss chance).
	Scent: Detect creatures by smell. Range 30 ft (60 upwind, 15 downwind).
	Tremorsense: Pinpoint anything moving in contact with the ground.

### Hazards
Weather
	Rain: -4 to Spot/Search. Ranges halved.
	Storms: Impossible ranged attacks. Listen penalties.
	Fog: Obscures sight beyond 5 ft (thick) or 60 ft (thin).

Temperature
	Cold: Fort saves or take nonlethal damage/fatigue. Metal armor acts as chill metal.
	Heat: Fort saves or take nonlethal damage/fatigue. Heavy clothing imposes penalties.

Starvation and Thirst
	Starvation: 3 days without food, then Con checks or take nonlethal damage + fatigue.
	Thirst: 1 day without water (less in heat), then Con checks or nonlethal damage + fatigue. Dehydration damage becomes lethal in hot environments.

Suffocation
	Hold breath for 2 rounds per point of Constitution.
	After that, Con checks (DC 10 +1/round).
	Failure: Unconscious (0 hp), Dying (-1 hp), Dead (-10 hp) in 3 rounds.

Natural Hazards
	Avalanches: Bury zone (8d6 dmg, buried) and Slide zone (3d6 dmg).
	Lava: 2d6 fire dmg/round (exposure), 20d6 (immersion).
	Smoke: Obscures vision. Fort saves or choke (spend round doing nothing).
	Quicksand: Swim checks to move. Failure results in sinking/suffocating.


(Interlude: Abstraction or Simulation - D&D leans toward abstraction for playability. Rules like hit points and AC are abstract limits, while rules like suffocation nod toward realism. The goal is believability, not perfect simulation.)



# Part IV: Combat

### Combat Basics
The Combat Sequence
1. Surprise Round: If some but not all combatants are aware of their opponents, a surprise round occurs. Aware combatants take one standard or move action.
2. Initiative: Everyone rolls `1d20 + Dex Modifier`. High roll goes first.
3. Combat Rounds: Combatants act in initiative order.
		On your turn, you can take a Full Round of actions (Standard + Move, or Full-Round).
		The cycle repeats until combat ends.

Action Types
	Standard Action: Attack, Cast a Spell, Use Special Ability.
	Move Action: Move speed, Draw Weapon, Stand Up, Open Door.

Attacks of Opportunity (AoO)
A free melee attack against a foe who lets their guard down.
	Threatened Area: Squares you can reach with a melee weapon (usually 5 ft).

# Part V-B: Alternative Magic Systems

While Vancian magic (Slots and Preparation) is the standard, the D&D universe supports several other methods of manipulating reality.

### 1. Psionics (Mind Magic)
Psionics is the art of tapping into internal mental reserves rather than external planes or deities.

The Core Mechanic: Power Points
Instead of spell slots, Psions and Psychic Warriors use a pool of Power Points (PP).
	Cost: A 1st-level power costs 1 PP. A 2nd-level power costs 3 PP. Formula roughly: `(Power Level x 2) - 1`.
	Manifester Level Cap: You cannot spend more PP on a single manifestation than your Manifester Level. (e.g., A 3rd-level Psion can spend max 3 PP).
	Augmentation: Many powers scale. *Energy Ray* deals 1d6 damage for 1 PP. For every extra 1 PP spent, it deals +1d6 damage.

Psionic Focus
A state of mental readiness.
	Gain Focus: Full-round action (Concentration DC 20).
	Maintain Focus: You stay focused until you expend it or fall unconscious.
	Expend Focus: You can "blow" your focus to "Take 15" on a Concentration check or activate a Psionic Feat.

Disciplines
	*Clairsentience* (Seer): Knowledge/Scrying.
	*Metacreativity* (Shaper): Ectoplasm constructs.
	*Psychokinesis* (Kineticist): Energy manipulation.
	*Psychometabolism* (Egoist): Body modification/Healing.
	*Psychoportation* (Nomad): Teleportation/Speed.
	*Telepathy* (Telepath): Mind control/Communication.

---

### 2. Invocations (Warlocks & Dragonfire Adepts)
Warlocks do not cast spells; they use Invocations, representing a permanent alteration of their being.

	Unlimited Use: Invocations can be used at-will. There is no daily limit.
	Spell-Like Abilities: They provoke AoOs and are subject to Spell Resistance.
	Eldritch Blast: The Warlock's primary attack. A ranged touch attack dealing raw magical damage (1d6 at 1st level, increasing every few levels).
	Shapes & Essences:
		*Blast Shape:* Modifies the range/area (e.g., *Eldritch Spear* increases range to 250 ft; *Eldritch Doom* becomes an area blast).
		*Eldritch Essence:* Modifies the effect (e.g., *Brimstone Blast* deals fire damage; *Utterdark Blast* deals negative levels).

---

### 3. Blade Magic (The Sublime Way)
Found in the *Tome of Battle*, this system replaces standard "I attack" combat with martial maneuvers (Warblade, Swordsage, Crusader).

Maneuver Mechanics
	Maneuvers: Special moves (Strikes, Boosts, Counters).
	Stances: Passive benefits active as long as you remain in the stance.
	Readied Maneuvers: You know many maneuvers but can only have a few "Readied" (loaded in your mind) at once.
	Recovery: Once used, a maneuver is expended (like a spell).
		*Warblade:* Attack an enemy and spend a swift action to recover all.
		*Swordsage:* Spend a full-round action to recover one.
		*Crusader:* Maneuvers are granted randomly each round from a deck-building mechanic.

The Nine Disciplines
1.  *Desert Wind:* Fire and speed (Scimitar/Spear).
2.  *Devoted Spirit:* Healing and alignment (Hammer/Falchion).
3.  *Diamond Mind:* Concentration and time (Rapier/Katana).
4.  *Iron Heart:* Pure skill and resilience (Longsword/Bastard Sword).
5.  *Setting Sun:* Throws and judo-style redirection (Unarmed/Quarterstaff).
6.  *Shadow Hand:* Stealth and supernatural assassination (Dagger/Short Sword).
7.  *Stone Dragon:* Toughness and power (Greatsword/Greataxe).
8.  *Tiger Claw:* Jumping and dual-wielding (Kukri/Claws).
9.  *White Raven:* Leadership and tactics (Longsword/Halberd).

---

### 4. Pact Magic (Binders)
Binders do not worship gods; they make deals with Vestiges—remnants of entities that no longer exist in reality.

Binding Mechanics
	Sealing the Pact: A 1-minute ritual to draw a seal and summon the Vestige. Requires a Binding Check (1d20 + Level + Cha).
	The Pact:
		*Good Pact:* You beat the DC. You get the powers and suppress the Vestige's influence.
		*Poor Pact:* You fail the DC. You get the powers but suffer a physical "Sign" and a behavioral "Influence" (e.g., you cannot lie).
	Cooldowns: Most Vestige powers are at-will but have a cooldown (usually 5 rounds) between uses.

Sample Vestiges
	*Amon:* Grants darkvision, a ram attack, and fire breath.
	*Leraje:* Grants expertise with bows and ricochet shots.
	*Naberius:* Grants fast ability healing and the ability to use skills untrained.

---

### 5. Shadow Magic (Shadowcasters)
Users manipulate the plane of shadow. It is a degradation of traditional magic—harder to learn, but eventually becoming effortless.

Paths and Mysteries
Spells are called Mysteries. They are grouped into "Paths" (sets of 3).
1.  Apprentice Mysteries: Work like spells (components, provoke AoO).
2.  Initiate Mysteries: At 7th level, Apprentice mysteries become *Spell-Like Abilities* (no components, 2 uses/day).
3.  Master Mysteries: At 13th level, Apprentice become *Supernatural Abilities* (no AoO, ignore SR, 3 uses/day).

The Umbral Sight: Shadowcasters gain superior Darkvision that can eventually see through magical darkness.

---

### 6. Truename Magic (Truenamers)
The universe is spoken into existence. By speaking the Truename of a creature or object, you can alter it.

The Truespeak Check
Magic requires a skill check: Truespeak (Int).
	The DC: `15 + (2 x Target's CR)` or `15 + (2 x Target's Hit Dice)`.
	The Law of Resistance: Every time you successfully speak a Truename, the DC to speak that *same* Truename increases by +2 for the rest of the day.
	Universal Truenames: You can target objects or locations with general names, but personal Truenames (requires research) are more powerful.

Utterances
These are the "spells" of Truenaming.
	*Lexicon of the Evolving Mind:* Buffs/Debuffs creatures. (e.g., *Word of Nurturing* heals; *Inertia Surge* stops movement).
	*Lexicon of the Crafted Tool:* Alters objects. (e.g., *Weapon of Energy* adds fire/cold to a sword).
	*Lexicon of the Perfected Map:* Alters the environment. (e.g., *Fog of Fear*).

# Part VI: Monsters & Bestiary

### Reading the Monster Entry
	Challenge Rating (CR): A monster’s CR tells you the level of the party for which it is a good challenge. A CR 5 monster is an appropriate challenge for a party of four 5th-level characters.
	Hit Dice (HD): Monsters don't just have HP; they have Hit Dice based on their type (e.g., Dragons use d12, Fey use d6). This determines their Base Attack Bonus and Saves.
	Alignment: The statistical norm for the creature. "Always Chaotic Evil" means it is innate (Demons). "Usually Neutral" means exceptions are common.
	Treasure: What loot the monster carries.
		*Standard:* Average loot for its CR.
		*Double/Triple:* Rich monsters (Dragons).
		*None:* Animals, Constructs.

### Monster Types
A monster's "Type" dictates its physiology, Hit Die, Attack Bonus, and Saving Throws.

| Type | Hit Die | BAB | Good Saves | Traits & Immunities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Aberration | d8 | 3/4 | Will | Darkvision 60ft. Weird anatomy. |
| Animal | d8 | 3/4 | Fort, Ref | Int 1 or 2. Low-light vision. Neutral alignment. |

### Improving Monsters
DMs can modify monsters to make them tougher without switching to a different creature.

1. Advancement (Adding Hit Dice)
You can simply add more Hit Dice to a monster.
	Effect: Increases HP, BAB, Saves, Skill Points, and Feats.
	Size Increase: Adding enough HD often increases a creature's size (e.g., Large to Huge).
		*Size Change Stats:* Gaining size usually grants Str +8, Con +4, Natural Armor +2, but applies Dex -2, AC -1, Attack -1.

2. Adding Class Levels
Monsters with Int 3 or higher can take class levels (like Fighter or Sorcerer).
	Associated Class: A class that fits the monster's strengths (e.g., Ogre Barbarian). Adds +1 CR per level.
	Non-Associated Class: A class that doesn't play to strengths (e.g., Ogre Wizard). Adds +1/2 CR per level until the class level equals the monster's original HD.

3. Templates
Templates are overlays that change a creature's type and stats.
	Acquired Template: Added to an existing creature (e.g., *Vampire, Lich, Lycanthrope*).
	Inherited Template: Born with the trait (e.g., *Half-Dragon, Celestial, Fiendish*).
	*Example:* Applying the Skeleton template to an Ogre makes it Undead, removes its Con score/Int score, and gives it immunity to cold.

		*Slots:* Head (Circlet/Helm), Face (Goggles/Lenses), Throat (Amulet), Shoulders (Cloak), Body (Vest/Robe), Torso (Shirt/Vestment), Arms (Bracers), Hands (Gloves), Ring (x2), Waist (Belt), Feet (Boots).
	Size: Magic armor and weapons must be sized for the wearer. Wondrous items (cloaks, rings) shrink or grow to fit the wearer.

Activation Methods

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Spell Completion | Standard | Yes | Reading a Scroll. Must have the spell on your class list and have the requisite ability score. |

| Use-Activated | Varies | No | Drinking a Potion, swinging a sword, wearing a ring. |

#### Magic Item Creation
Feat holders can craft items.

	Creation Cost: To make an item, you spend 50% of the Base Price in raw materials and 1/25th of the Base Price in XP.
	Time: 1 day per 1,000 gp of the Base Price.
	Prerequisites: You must meet CL requirements, have the specific spell prepared (or access to it), and have the relevant Item Creation Feat.

Pricing Estimates (Guidelines)
Use these formulas to estimate the value of custom items.

| Effect | Base Price Formula | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Ability Bonus | `Bonus squared x 1,000 gp` | *Belt of Giant Str +4* (4x4=16; 16,000 gp) |
| Armor Bonus | `Bonus squared x 1,000 gp` | *Bracers of Armor +2* (2x2=4; 4,000 gp) |
| Weapon Bonus | `Bonus squared x 2,000 gp` | *+1 Longsword* (2,000 gp + 315 gp item cost) |
| Save Bonus | `Bonus squared x 1,000 gp` | *Cloak of Resistance +1* (1,000 gp) |
| Skill Bonus | `Bonus squared x 100 gp` | *Cloak of Elvenkind* (+5 Hide; 2,500 gp) |
| Spell Effect (Single Use) | `Spell Lvl x Caster Lvl x 50 gp` | *Potion of Cure Light* (1 x 1 x 50 = 50 gp) |
| Spell Effect (Wand) | `Spell Lvl x Caster Lvl x 750 gp` | *Wand of Fireball* (5th level caster: 3 x 5 x 750 = 11,250 gp) |
| Spell Effect (Command) | `Spell Lvl x Caster Lvl x 1,800 gp` | *Cape of the Mountebank* (Dim. Door) |
| Spell Effect (Continuous) | `Spell Lvl x Caster Lvl x 2,000 gp` | *Lantern of Revealing* (Invis. Purge) |

*Note: A spell with a duration of "1 round/level" costs 4x as much for a continuous item. "1 minute/level" costs 2x as much.*

#### Common Magic Items
	Potions: Single-use liquid spells. Target must be the drinker. Max Spell Level 3.
	Scrolls: Single-use written spells.
	Wands: hold 50 charges. Max Spell Level 4. To use, you must have the spell on your class list.
	Staffs: hold 50 charges. Can hold high-level spells. Uses the wielder's Caster Level and Ability Score for DCs if they are higher than the staff's.
	Rods: Metal scepters with unique combat or metamagic utility (e.g., *Rod of Metamagic, Extend*).

#### Psionic Items
Psionics function similarly to magic.
	Magic-Psionic Transparency: Unless the DM rules otherwise, spells affect psionic items and powers affect magic items equally. *Dispel Magic* works on Psionics; *Dispel Psionics* works on Magic.

Psionic Equivalents

#### Special & Cursed Properties
	Intelligent Items: Some items have Sentience (Int/Wis/Cha), alignments, and the ability to communicate (Empathy or Speech). They have an Ego score. If the wielder acts against the item's purpose, they must make a Will save vs. Ego or fall under the item's control.
	Cursed Items: Items that function incorrectly.
		*Delusion:* User thinks it works, but it doesn't.
		*Opposite Effect:* Gives penalties instead of bonuses.
		*Drawback:* Works, but causes a negative side effect (e.g., character's hair grows 1 inch per hour).

# Appendices

### Designer Notes & Philosophy
	The Living Game: D&D rules evolve based on how people play. Rules are not static; they are a framework for a personalized experience.
	Rule Death: Rules are removed ("killed") when they stop being fun or bog down play (e.g., THAC0, facing).
	Abstraction vs. Simulation: D&D chooses abstraction (HP, AC) over realism (broken bones, specific organ damage) to keep the game playable and heroic.
	The "Free" Action: Swift and Immediate actions were created because "Free actions" became too cluttered and powerful, needing a resource limit.
