# Dungeons & Dragons 3.5e: Comprehensive Rules Reference

# Part I: The Basics

### Introduction
The book you hold in your hands is the definitive guide for how to play the 3.5 revision of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Roleplaying Game. It gathers resources from a wide variety of supplements, rules errata, and rules clarifications. When a preexisting core book or supplement differs with the rules herein, this document is meant to take precedence.

Adjudication
Essential to the D&D game is the Dungeon Master (DM). The DM is the referee and storyteller for the game, as well as the judge when the rules don't cover a particular topic. No set of rules can cover every possible circumstance in a game meant to mimic life in a fantasy world. DMs are expected to use knowledge of existing rules, common sense, real-world knowledge, and a sense of fun when dealing with special cases.

### The Core Mechanic
Whenever your character attempts an act that has some chance of failure, the process is:
1. Roll a d20.
2. Add all relevant modifiers (from ability scores, skills, feats, etc.).
3. Compare the result to a Target Number (Difficulty Class or an opponent's roll).

Formula: `d20 Roll + Modifiers ≥ Target Number` (Success)

### Dice Notation
	Standard Dice: An expression like `3d4+3` means: Roll three 4-sided dice, sum the results, and add 3.
	Percentile Dice (d%): Roll two 10-sided dice (d10). Designate one as the "tens" digit and the other as the "ones" digit. A roll of `0` on the tens die and `5` on the ones die is 5. A roll of two `0`s is 100.

### Mathematical Rules
	Rounding: Always round down, even if the fraction is one-half or larger, unless a rule specifies a minimum of 1 (such as for Hit Points or damage).
	Multiplying:
		Abstract Values (Modifiers, Rolls): When multiple multipliers apply, combine them. The first multiplier works normally. Each additional multiplier adds 1 less than its value. (Example: A `x2` and another `x2` multiplier results in a `x3` multiplier (`2 + (2-1) = 3`). Three doubles results in a quadruple.)
		Real-World Values (Distance, Weight): Use normal multiplication. (Example: Doubling weight (`x8`) then turning to stone (`x3`) results in `x24` total weight.)

### Order of Rules Application
The D&D game assumes a specific order of rules application: General to specific to exception. A general rule is a basic guideline, but a more specific rule takes precedence. An exception is a particular kind of specific rule that contradicts or breaks another rule.

### Time
Time works for characters in the imaginary world of D&D like it does in the real world. Minutes, hours, days, and months can pass as the characters explore and grow in power. Only during certain situations is the measure of time more precise. Then the round is used.
	Round: Combat is played in rounds. Each round represents 6 seconds in the game world, regardless of how long it takes to play out the round. A minute contains 10 rounds.



# Part II: Character Building Blocks

### Ability Scores
An ability score's modifier is calculated as: `(Score - 10) / 2`, rounded down.

| Score | Modifier | Score | Modifier | Score | Modifier |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | -5 | 12-13 | +1 | 24-25 | +7 |
| 2-3 | -4 | 14-15 | +2 | 26-27 | +8 |
| 4-5 | -3 | 16-17 | +3 | 28-29 | +9 |
| 6-7 | -2 | 18-19 | +4 | 30-31 | +10 |
| 8-9 | -1 | 20-21 | +5 | etc. | ... |
| 10-11 | +0 | 22-23 | +6 | | |

The Six Abilities

| Ability | Applies Modifier To | Key Skills |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Strength (Str) | • Melee attack rolls<br>• Melee/Thrown weapon damage rolls<br>• Strength-based skill checks<br>• Strength checks (e.g., breaking doors) | Climb, Jump, Swim |

| Constitution (Con) | • Hit Points per Hit Die (minimum 1 per level)<br>• Fortitude saving throws<br>• Constitution-based skill checks | Concentration |
| Intelligence (Int) | • Skill points gained per level (minimum 1)<br>• Number of starting languages<br>• Intelligence-based skill checks<br>• Wizard bonus spells & spell DCs | Appraise, Craft, Decipher Script, Disable Device, Forgery, Knowledge, Search, Spellcraft |
| Wisdom (Wis) | • Will saving throws<br>• Wisdom-based skill checks<br>• Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger bonus spells & spell DCs | Heal, Listen, Profession, Sense Motive, Spot, Survival |

#### Ability Score Loss
Some attacks deal damage to an ability score in the form of ability damage or ability drain.
	Ability Damage: Temporarily reduces a score. If, during a 24-hour period, a creature gets a full 8 hours of sleep, that creature recovers 1 ability score point per damaged ability score. Complete bed rest doubles this rate. Long-term care (Heal check DC 15) can also double recovery.
	Ability Drain: Permanently reduces a score. Only restored by magic (such as restoration).

Losing All Points
A score cannot drop below 0.
	Strength 0: Helpless. Cannot move.
	Dexterity 0: Helpless. Motionless and rigid.
	Constitution 0: Dead.
	Intelligence 0: Unconscious (comalike stupor). Helpless.
	Wisdom 0: Unconscious (deep sleep with nightmares). Helpless.
	Charisma 0: Unconscious (catatonic stupor). Helpless.

#### Nonabilities
Some creatures lack an ability score entirely (marked as "—"). The modifier is +0.
	No Strength: Can't exert force. Physical manipulation is impossible.
	No Dexterity: Can't move. Auto-fails Reflex saves.
	No Constitution: No body or metabolism (undead/constructs). Immune to Fortitude saves (unless harmless/works on objects), ability damage/drain, fatigue, and exhaustion.
	No Intelligence: Mindless. Immune to mind-affecting effects. Auto-fails Int checks. No feats/skills.
	No Wisdom: Is an object, not a creature.
	No Charisma: Is an object, not a creature.

	Little Creatures (Tiny, Diminutive, Fine): Take up less than 1 square. Have 0 reach (must enter opponent's square to attack, provoking AoO).
	Big Creatures (Large+): Take up more than 1 square. Usually have Reach (10 ft+).

### Skills
General Skill Rules
	Skill Check Formula: `d20 + Skill Ranks + Ability Modifier + Misc. Modifiers`
	Skill Ranks:
		Class Skill: 1 rank per skill point. Max rank = `Character Level + 3`.
		Cross-Class Skill: 1/2 rank per skill point. Max rank = `(Character Level + 3) / 2`.

Checks and Success
	Take 10: When not threatened or distracted, you can opt for a result of 10 on the d20 roll.
	Take 20: With ample time and no penalty for failure, you can opt for a result of 20 on the d20 roll. This takes 20 times longer than a normal check.
	Degrees of Success: Usually, meeting the DC is enough. Sometimes beating it by 5 or 10 yields better results.
	Aid Another: Make a DC 10 check with the same skill to give an ally a +2 bonus.
	Skill Synergy: Having 5 or more ranks in one skill gives you a +2 bonus on checks with specific related skills.

# Part III: Exploration & Movement

### Movement Modes
Your speed is determined by your race and encumbrance. You can move your speed as a move action.

	Terrain: Highways (x1), Roads (x1), Trails (x1), Trackless (x1/2 to x3/4).
	Getting Lost: In poor visibility or difficult terrain, lead character makes Survival check each hour. Failure means random movement.

### The Environment

	Thirst: 1 day without water (less in heat), then Con checks or nonlethal damage + fatigue. Dehydration damage becomes lethal in hot environments.

Suffocation
	Hold breath for 2 rounds per point of Constitution.
	After that, Con checks (DC 10 +1/round).
	Failure: Unconscious (0 hp), Dying (-1 hp), Dead (-10 hp) in 3 rounds.

Natural Hazards
	Avalanches: Bury zone (8d6 dmg, buried) and Slide zone (3d6 dmg).
	Lava: 2d6 fire dmg/round (exposure), 20d6 (immersion).
	Smoke: Obscures vision. Fort saves or choke (spend round doing nothing).
	Quicksand: Swim checks to move. Failure results in sinking/suffocating.


(Interlude: Abstraction or Simulation - D&D leans toward abstraction for playability. Rules like hit points and AC are abstract limits, while rules like suffocation nod toward realism. The goal is believability, not perfect simulation.)

# Appendices

### Designer Notes & Philosophy
	The Living Game: D&D rules evolve based on how people play. Rules are not static; they are a framework for a personalized experience.
	Rule Death: Rules are removed ("killed") when they stop being fun or bog down play (e.g., THAC0, facing).
	Abstraction vs. Simulation: D&D chooses abstraction (HP, AC) over realism (broken bones, specific organ damage) to keep the game playable and heroic.
	The "Free" Action: Swift and Immediate actions were created because "Free actions" became too cluttered and powerful, needing a resource limit.
