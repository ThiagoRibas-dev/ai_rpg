### Dungeons and Dragons 3.5e (D&D 3.5e) Core Game Mechanics

#### The Core Mechanic

When attempting an action with a chance of failure, the process is:
1.  Roll a d20.
2.  Add all relevant modifiers (from ability scores, skills, feats, etc.).
3.  Compare the result to a Target Number (Difficulty Class or an opponent's roll).

Formula: `d20 Roll + Modifiers ≥ Target Number` (Success)

#### Dice Notation

	Standard Dice: An expression like `3d4+3` means: Roll three 4-sided dice, sum the results, and add 3.
	Percentile Dice (d%): Roll two 10-sided dice (d10). Designate one as the "tens" digit and the other as the "ones" digit. A roll of `0` on the tens die and `5` on the ones die is 5. A roll of two `0`s is 100.

#### Mathematical Rules

	Rounding: Always round down, unless a rule specifies a minimum of 1 (such as for Hit Points or damage).
	Multiplying:
		Abstract Values (Modifiers, Rolls): When multiple multipliers apply, combine them. The first multiplier works normally. Each additional multiplier adds 1 less than its value.
			*Example:* A `x2` and another `x2` multiplier results in a `x3` multiplier (`2 + (2-1) = 3`).
		Real-World Values (Distance, Weight): Use normal multiplication.
			*Example:* Doubling weight (`x8`) then turning to stone (`x3`) results in `x24` total weight.


### Ability Scores

An ability score's modifier is calculated as: `(Score - 10) / 2`, rounded down.

| Score   | Modifier | Score   | Modifier | Score   | Modifier |
| :------ | :------- | :------ | :------- | :------ | :------- |
| 1       | -5       | 12-13   | +1       | 24-25   | +7       |
| 2-3     | -4       | 14-15   | +2       | 26-27   | +8       |
| 4-5     | -3       | 16-17   | +3       | 28-29   | +9       |
| 6-7     | -2       | 18-19   | +4       | 30-31   | +10      |
| 8-9     | -1       | 20-21   | +5       | etc.    | ...      |
| 10-11   | +0       | 22-23   | +6       |         |          |

### Combat Rules

#### Combat Sequence

1.  Surprise Round (if applicable): Combatants who are aware of the enemy can take one standard or move action.
2.  Initiative: All combatants roll `1d20 + Dex Modifier`.
3.  Combat Rounds:
		Combatants act in initiative order, from highest to lowest.
		On your turn, you can take a full round's worth of actions (e.g., a standard action and a move action).
		The round ends after the combatant with the lowest initiative has acted. The cycle repeats.

		Take 20: With ample time and no penalty for failure, you can opt for a result of 20 on the d20 roll. This takes 20 times longer than a normal check.
