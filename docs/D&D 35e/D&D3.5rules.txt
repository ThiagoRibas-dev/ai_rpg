D&D 3.5e System Framework

The d20 System: Core Mechanic
The D&D 3.5e framework is based on the **d20 System**, where most actions are resolved by rolling a 20-sided die (d20). Success is achieved when the result of the die roll plus all applicable **modifiers** meets or exceeds a target number, known as the **Difficulty Class (DC)** or **Armor Class (AC)**.

d20 Roll + Modifiers ≥ Target Number (DC/AC)
1. Abilities, Skills, and Feats
The Six Ability Scores
A score of 10 or 11 is considered average. The relevant **modifier** added to checks is derived by the formula: (Score - 10) / 2 (rounded down).

Strength (STR): Physical power, Melee Attack/Damage, Climb/Jump/Swim.
Dexterity (DEX): Agility, Ranged Attack Rolls, Armor Class, Reflex Saves.
Constitution (CON): Health, Hit Points, Fortitude Saves.
Intelligence (INT): Reasoning, Knowledge skills, number of Skill Points.
Wisdom (WIS): Willpower, Perception skills, Will Saves.
Charisma (CHA): Personality, Social skills, Turning Undead.
Skills
Skills are specific areas of learned ability, linked to a single Ability Score. The Skill Check formula is:

d20 + Skill Ranks + Ability Mod + Misc ≥ DC
**Skill Ranks:** Purchased with **Skill Points** (determined by Class and INT modifier).
**Class Skills:** Skills associated with the character's class cost 1 point per rank.
**Cross-Class Skills:** Skills not associated with the character's class cost 2 points per rank and max out at half the normal rank limit.
**Skill Tricks:** An optional system where two ranks in a skill can unlock a special, limited maneuver.
Feats
Feats are special abilities that grant new capabilities or improve existing ones (e.g., *Power Attack*, *Improved Initiative*). They are a key source of character customization.

All characters gain a feat at 1st level, and an additional feat every three levels thereafter (3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, 18th).
Humans gain an extra bonus feat at 1st level.
Some classes (like the Fighter) receive additional bonus feats from a restricted list.
Feats often have prerequisites, requiring a minimum score in an ability, a certain number of ranks in a skill, or possession of a previous feat.
2. Character and Creature Framework
Races and Templates
**Races:** Provide initial ability score modifiers, movement speed, size, and racial features (e.g., an Elf gains **+2 DEX, -2 CON**, low-light vision, and immunity to sleep spells).
**Templates:** Modifications that can be applied to a creature (the base creature) to alter its stats, abilities, type, and subtypes. Templates typically include powerful additions like flight, damage reduction, and special senses (e.g., the Vampire or Half-Dragon template).
Class Progression (The Chassis)
A character's class level defines their core competency tracks, which advance at different rates:

**Hit Die (HD):** Determines how much HP a character gains per level (d4, d6, d8, d10, or d12).
**Base Attack Bonus (BAB):** The foundational bonus for attack rolls.
**Saving Throws:** Each class designates one or more saves (**Fortitude, Reflex, Will**) as "Good" (faster progression) or "Poor" (slower progression).
**Caster Level (CL):** Tracks the power and effects of spells.
Progression Tracks (Levels 1-20 Summary)
Type	Example Class	BAB Progression	Good Save Total	Poor Save Total
Full BAB (Martial)	Fighter, Barbarian	Full (BAB=Level) to **+20**	**+12** at level 20	**+6** at level 20
3/4 BAB (Mixed)	Cleric, Rogue, Bard	3/4 of Level to **+15**	**+12** at level 20	**+6** at level 20
1/2 BAB (Caster)	Wizard, Sorcerer	1/2 of Level to **+10**	**+12** at level 20	**+6** at level 20
3. Standard Character Creation Process
Character creation follows a strict sequence to ensure statistical dependencies are correctly calculated. The order is:

Generate Ability Scores: Roll dice or use a Point Buy system to determine the raw scores for STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, and CHA.
Choose Race: Select a race (e.g., Human, Elf). This applies immediate modifiers to the ability scores (e.g., +2 DEX, -2 CON for Elf). This step must precede Class choice as it affects score requirements for feats/multiclassing.
Choose Class and Determine Core Chassis: Select a starting class (e.g., Fighter, Wizard). This determines Hit Die, Base Attack Bonus, Saving Throw progressions, and the number of Skill Points gained per level.
Determine Skill Points and Ranks: Calculate the number of skill points available (based on INT modifier and Class). Spend these points to buy ranks in Class Skills and Cross-Class Skills.
Select Feats: Choose initial feats (at least one at 1st level, plus any bonus feats from Race or Class), ensuring all prerequisites are met by the character's current scores, ranks, and BAB.
Calculate Secondary Stats: Determine final statistics, including Hit Points (roll HD + CON Mod, plus full max HD at 1st level), Armor Class (AC), and saving throw bonuses.
Purchase Equipment: Spend starting gold (determined by Class) on weapons, armor, and gear.
4. Combat and Defenses
Attack Rolls
To successfully hit a target, an attack roll must meet or exceed the target's Armor Class (AC). Critical hits occur on a natural 20 (and possibly a successful confirmation roll) and critical misses on a natural 1.

**Attack Roll = d20 + Base Attack Bonus (BAB) + Ability Modifier (STR for Melee, DEX for Ranged) + Size Modifiers + Weapon Enhancement/Feat Modifiers**
Defenses
Armor Class (AC): The target number for physical attacks.
**Standard AC = 10 + Armor Bonus + Shield Bonus + Dexterity Modifier + Size Modifier + Natural Armor**
Touch AC: The target number for attacks that ignore physical armor (e.g., ray spells). Calculated as AC without the Armor, Shield, or Natural Armor bonuses.
Flat-Footed AC: The target number when caught unawares (e.g., before acting in the first round of combat). Calculated as AC without the Dexterity or Dodge bonuses.
Saving Throws: Used to resist spells, poison, and special effects. The three types are Fortitude (CON), Reflex (DEX), and Will (WIS).
5. Magic Systems
The core of D&D 3.5e magic is the Vancian system, but numerous supplements expanded the game to include powerful alternative magic-like systems.

Standard Spellcasting (Vancian Magic)
**Spell Slots:** Casters gain a limited number of spell slots per day (0-9th level) and must "prepare" specific spells into those slots (Wizards, Clerics) or cast from a known list spontaneously (Sorcerers, Bards).
**Spell DC:** The Difficulty Class to save against a spell is calculated as: **10 + Spell Level + Caster's Ability Modifier** (INT for Wizard, WIS for Cleric, CHA for Sorcerer).
**Arcane:** Wizards and Sorcerers. Wizards rely on a spellbook. Sorcerers cast spontaneously. Arcane casters typically incur an "Arcane Spell Failure Chance" when wearing armor.
**Divine:** Clerics and Druids. Cast without the risk of spell failure and typically access their full spell list daily.
Alternative and Complex Systems
**Psionics:** (from *Expanded Psionics Handbook*). A distinct power source utilizing a pool of **Power Points** rather than spell slots, offering greater flexibility in powering "powers" (equivalent to spells).
**Invocations:** (from *Complete Arcane*). Used by the Warlock class. These are potent, often utility-focused abilities that can be used **at-will** (unlimited uses per day).
**Martial Maneuvers/Stances:** (from *Tome of Battle*). A system for martial classes (Warblade, Crusader, Swordsage) using tactical maneuvers that are readied and refreshed **per-encounter** or **per-combat**, rather than per-day.
**Binding:** (from *Tome of Magic*). Used by Binders who make pacts with powerful **Vestiges** to gain their abilities for a limited time.
**Incarnum:** (from *Magic of Incarnum*). A system of **soul-stuff** where users shape raw Incarnum into **Soulmelds** (magic items) and power them by investing **Essentia**.
**Shadowcasting:** (from *Tome of Magic*). Shadowcasters use **Mysteries** (spells) with a unique preparation and recovery mechanic based on the ambient light level.
