        "mechanic": "When a character attempts something uncertain, roll 1d20, add all relevant modifiers (ability, skill ranks, base attack bonus, feats, etc.) and compare the total to a Difficulty Class (DC) or an opponent's roll.",
        "success": "If the result equals or exceeds the DC or opposing check, the attempt succeeds. If it falls short, the attempt fails, often with narrative consequences.",
        "crit": "On a natural 20, an attack automatically hits and usually threatens a critical; if the confirmation roll also hits, damage is multiplied by the weapon's critical multiplier. Some weapons expand the threat range.",
        "fumble": "On an attack roll, a natural 1 is always a miss. Saving throws also treat a natural 1 as an automatic failure and a natural 20 as an automatic success."

        "combat": "Combat occurs in rounds of about six seconds. 1) Determine surprise: if some combatants are unaware, a surprise round occurs where only aware creatures act. 2) Everyone rolls initiative (1d20 + Dexterity modifier); act in descending order. 3) On your turn you may take a standard action and a move action (or a full-round action), plus free/swift actions as allowed. 4) Attacks are d20 + base attack bonus + relevant modifiers vs the target’s Armor Class; damage reduces hit points. 5) Special maneuvers (grapples, trips, bull rushes, etc.) use touch attacks plus opposed checks. Rounds repeat until the fight ends.",
        "exploration": "Outside combat, characters explore using movement, skills, and abilities. The DM sets DCs for tasks like climbing, sneaking, tracking, searching, or deciphering. Skill checks are d20 + ranks + ability modifier + miscellaneous modifiers. Time is measured in minutes, hours, or days; hazards such as falling, suffocation, traps, and environmental effects are resolved with checks, saving throws, or fixed damage.",
        "social": "Interaction uses skills such as Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, Gather Information, and Sense Motive. Diplomacy can shift a creature’s attitude along a scale from Hostile to Helpful given enough time; Bluff opposes Sense Motive; Intimidate can demoralize foes or extract cooperation. The DM sets DCs or opposed checks and interprets results in terms of attitude, information, or concessions.",
        "downtime": "Between adventures, characters rest, craft items, research, train, or manage organizations. Natural healing restores hit points per day of rest; ability damage heals over time or via magic. Spellcasters prepare spells, crafters spend XP and gold to make magic items, and characters level up when they reach XP thresholds: choose a class, update hit points, base attack bonus, saving throws, skill ranks, feats, and class features as per level progression.",
        "character_creation": "Dungeons & Dragons 3.5e - Character Creation Procedure\\n\\n1. Concept\\n   - Decide broadly who your character is: archetype, role in the party, personality, and basic backstory.\\n\\n2. Determine Ability Scores\\n   - Generate the six ability scores using the method allowed in your campaign (rolling, point-buy, or standard array).\\n   - Assign the scores to STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, and CHA to suit your concept.\\n\\n3. Choose Race\\n   - Pick a race and apply racial ability adjustments, size, speed, vision, languages, and racial traits (such as weapon familiarity or saving throw bonuses).\\n\\n4. Choose Class\\n   - Choose a class (or classes, if starting as a multiclass character with DM approval).\\n   - Note base attack bonus, base saves, skill list, class features, and hit die for 1st level.\\n\\n5. Hit Points and Level-1 Basics\\n   - At 1st level, set hit points based on your class hit die (often maximum at 1st level) plus CON modifier.\\n   - Record base attack bonus, base saves, and class features that apply at level 1.\\n\\n6. Skills and Feats\\n   - Calculate skill points for 1st level (including the ×4 multiplier) and spend them on class and cross-class skills according to the rules.\\n   - Choose 1st-level feat(s) granted by level and any bonus feats from race or class.\\n\\n7. Equipment and Money\\n   - Determine starting gold based on class (or use equipment packages if your group prefers).\\n   - Purchase armor, weapons, adventuring gear, spell components, and other essentials.\\n\\n8. Derived Statistics\\n   - Compute Armor Class (10 + armor/shield + DEX modifier + other modifiers).\\n   - Compute melee and ranged attack bonuses, saving throws, initiative, and speed.\\n   - For spellcasters, note spells known/prepared, save DCs, and any spellbook or prayer rules.\\n\\n9. Finishing Touches\\n   - Fill in name, alignment, deity (if any), appearance, personality, and background.\\n   - Check encumbrance and any special notes from race, class, or feats.\\n\\nAfter these steps, the character is a complete 1st-level 3.5e character, ready for play."
