    "combat": "Conflicts are run in exchanges. 1) Establish situation, zones, and who is involved. 2) Determine turn order, usually by comparing skills or deciding who reasonably acts first. 3) On their turn, a character takes one action: Overcome, Create an Advantage, Attack, or Defend as appropriate. 4) Attacks that deal shifts of harm force the defender to absorb them using stress boxes and consequences. 5) When a character can no longer absorb all the shifts from a hit with available stress and consequences, they are taken out and the victor decides what happens (within reason).",
    "exploration": "Use Overcome to bypass obstacles, hazards, locks, or abstract challenges; use Create an Advantage to discover or establish helpful situation aspects. The GM sets passive opposition or rolls active opposition. Difficulty targets usually map to the Fate ladder (e.g. Fair (+2) for modest challenges, Good (+3)/Great (+4) when the situation is demanding).",
    "social": "Use skills such as Rapport, Deceive, Provoke, Contacts, and Empathy in either simple Overcome rolls or full social conflicts. Aspects on characters and the scene (High Concepts, Troubles, situation aspects) are invoked for bonuses or compels to drive drama. Mental stress and consequences represent emotional or reputational harm.",
    "downtime": "Between big problems, resolve recovery and advancement. Clear all checked stress once characters have a breather. Begin recovery on consequences according to their severity and narrative healing scenes. Apply milestones: Minor milestones at the end of most sessions, Significant after scenarios or major plot beats, Major when the campaign changes direction. Adjust skills, aspects, and stunts according to milestone rules."
