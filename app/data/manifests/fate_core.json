    "combat": "Conflicts are run in exchanges. 1) Establish situation, zones, and who is involved. 2) Determine turn order, usually by comparing skills or deciding who reasonably acts first. 3) On their turn, a character takes one action: Overcome, Create an Advantage, Attack, or Defend as appropriate. 4) Attacks that deal shifts of harm force the defender to absorb them using stress boxes and consequences. 5) When a character can no longer absorb all the shifts from a hit with available stress and consequences, they are taken out and the victor decides what happens (within reason).",
    "exploration": "Use Overcome to bypass obstacles, hazards, locks, or abstract challenges; use Create an Advantage to discover or establish helpful situation aspects. The GM sets passive opposition or rolls active opposition. Difficulty targets usually map to the Fate ladder (e.g. Fair (+2) for modest challenges, Good (+3)/Great (+4) when the situation is demanding).",
    "social": "Use skills such as Rapport, Deceive, Provoke, Contacts, and Empathy in either simple Overcome rolls or full social conflicts. Aspects on characters and the scene (High Concepts, Troubles, situation aspects) are invoked for bonuses or compels to drive drama. Mental stress and consequences represent emotional or reputational harm.",
    "downtime": "Between big problems, resolve recovery and advancement. Clear all checked stress once characters have a breather. Begin recovery on consequences according to their severity and narrative healing scenes. Apply milestones: Minor milestones at the end of most sessions, Significant after scenarios or major plot beats, Major when the campaign changes direction. Adjust skills, aspects, and stunts according to milestone rules.",
    "character_creation": "Fate Core - Character Creation Procedure\\n\\n1. High Concept and Trouble\\n   - Define a high concept aspect that captures who your character is and what they do.\\n   - Define a trouble aspect that represents their central problem, flaw, or complication.\\n\\n2. Name and Basic Idea\\n   - Choose a name.\\n   - Note a brief description of who they are and how they fit into the setting you created together.\\n\\n3. Phase One - First Adventure\\n   - Describe a dramatic “first adventure” your character starred in before the campaign.\\n   - From that story, write an aspect that reflects something important about them.\\n\\n4. Phases Two and Three - Crossing Paths\\n   - In Phase Two, describe how your character appeared in another PC’s first adventure; write an aspect from that experience.\\n   - In Phase Three, repeat the process with a different PC’s story; write a fourth aspect.\\n   - At the end, you typically have five aspects: high concept, trouble, and three additional aspects from the phases.\\n\\n5. Skills\\n   - Build a skill pyramid (or other arrangement agreed for your campaign), placing your best skill at the top and filling out lower ranks beneath it.\\n   - Ensure the final skill distribution matches the ladder and number of skills your game is using.\\n\\n6. Stunts\\n   - Choose three stunts to start with (or the number specified for your campaign).\\n   - Stunts should be tied to skills and give you focused mechanical benefits, discounts, or exceptions to the usual rules.\\n\\n7. Refresh and Fate Points\\n   - Set your refresh to the agreed starting value (commonly 3 in standard Fate Core).\\n   - Your starting pool of fate points at the beginning of a session equals your current refresh.\\n\\n8. Stress and Consequences\\n   - Determine physical and mental stress tracks based on your skills and any relevant stunts.\\n   - Note your available consequence slots (mild, moderate, severe) and any extras the campaign permits.\\n\\nOnce everyone has completed these steps, you have a cast of interconnected protagonists with aspects, skills, stunts, and stress tracks ready to play."
