# Gemini-Aided Development Guide

This file serves as a central rules and filedocument index and guide for AI-aided development within the AI-RPG project. It outlines the overall development workflow, provides a high-level specification of the project, and indexes key documentation files and TODO lists to facilitate efficient development.

# Development Workflow

This workflow is designed to leverage AI agent capabilities while maintaining project-specific quality standards and clear human oversight.
The development environment is Windows and the Shell is Powershell.

1.  **Task Ingestion & Contextual Analysis:** Perform an initial examination of the request and analyze relevant project context (e.g., file structure, existing documentation, previous TODOs).
2.  **Strategic Plan Formulation & Presentation:** Formulate a detailed step-by-step plan, including the 'what, where, how, why' of the implementation, breaking it into components, and considering potential downstream effects. Include code snippet examples where appropriate, then present this detailed plan to the user.
3.  **User Approval & Task Kick-off:** Request and wait for user permission to execute the plan. Upon approval, create a temporary TODO file (e.g., `vX_TODO.md`) to track the implementation steps.
4.  **Iterative Execution & Progress Tracking:** Execute the plan, performing implementation tasks (reading files, creating/editing/deleting code, etc.) in an iterative manner. Continuously update the temporary TODO file to reflect progress, marking completed steps and adding new ones as needed.
5.  **Automated Quality & Integrity Checks:** Perform project-specific quality checks: Check the work for missing or incomplete implementations. Run `ruff check --fix .` to ensure code quality and adherence to style guidelines. Run the game or relevant tests to check for functional errors.
6.  **Finalization, Documentation & Handoff:** Summarize the changes made, update relevant project files (e.g., indexes, main TODOs, `GEMINI.md`), and provide a concise summary of the completed work. Ask for the next step, signaling readiness for a new task or further instructions.

## High-Level Specification

An advanced, text-based RPG engine powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). The engine will dynamically generate narrative, manage game state, and respond to player actions by intelligently retrieving and managing context. The core design focuses on a modular architecture that separates state management, decision logic, and LLM interaction, allowing for support of multiple LLM backends like Gemini and OpenAI.

## Detailed Specification & Documentation

This project is documented across several files to keep the information organized and easy to navigate.

- **[V2.1 TODO](todos/v2.1_TODO.md)**

## Notes

**Planning:** Before making any changes, we will perform an iterative planning step, laying out a detailed step-by-step implementation plan (what, where, how, why). Only once the plan has been accepted, we will execute the plan and edit the files in question.

**Editing Files:** Avoid trying to edit whole files at once if possible. Edit specific, directed, targeted snippets at a time, always planning the whole chain of edits beforehand. Be aware of replacing snippets that exist in multiple parts of a given file. Files should be kept as relatively small. If a file is becoming too large (500+ lines) then split the file into two or more.

**Ruff Linter:** During Execution, after performing a batch of changes, always run `ruff check . --fix` to ensure things are in order.

**Logging:** All code will contain tracking logs that output to the console so that errors are easier to debug.
